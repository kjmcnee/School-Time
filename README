Since the time that my high school uses is different from the actual time, the time displayed on the computer is different than the time displayed on the school clocks. To address this, I created a little clock that sits in the corner of the screen and displays the school's time.

I also change the colour of the clock to green for "green screen" (time between classes).

Double click the clock to close the program.
